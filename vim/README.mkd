# Git for Vim

## Commit Message Syntax Highlighting

Check that you have a git commit syntax file: `gitcommit.vim`

Mine was in `/usr/share/vim/vim73/syntax/gitcommit.vim`.

Use that as a base for your customization, but don't edit it directly.

Place the customizations in your `~/.vim/after/syntax/gitcommit.vim` file. _Create one, if necessary._

Mine is in this folder.
